/**
 * The main factory class of CirJackson package, used to configure and construct reader (aka parser, [CirJsonParser])
 * and writer (aka generator, [CirJsonGenerator]) instances.
 *
 * Factory instances are thread-safe and reusable after configuration (if any). Typically, applications and services use
 * only a single globally shared factory instance, unless they need differently configured factories. Factory reuse is
 * important if efficiency matters; most recycling of expensive construct is done on per-factory basis.
 *
 * Creation of a factory instance is a light-weight operation, and since there is no need for pluggable alternative
 * implementations (as there is no "standard" CirJSON processor API to implement), the default constructor is used for
 * constructing factory instances.
